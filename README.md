# sofe-deplanifester
A manifest deployment service for [sofe](https://github.com/CanopyTax/sofe). Also can host the manifest file.

## Installation and usage
1. `npm install -g sofe-deplanifester`
2. `sofe-deplanifester conf.js`

## Configuration file
If no configuration file is present, sofe-deplanifester defaults to using the filesystem to host the manifest file, which is called `sofe-manifest.json` and created in the current working directory. If username and password is included, http basic auth will be required. If username and password is not provided, no http auth will be needed.

### Option 1: javascript module
Example conf.js
```js
//conf.js
exports = {
    username: "admin",
    password: "1234",
    manifestFormat: "sofe|importmap",
    readManifest: function() {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            const manifest = ''; //read a string from somewhere
            resolve(manifest); //must resolve a string
        });
    },

    writeManifest: function() {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            //write the file....
            resolve(); //you don't have to call resolve with any value
        }
    }
}
```
### Option 2: json file
Example config.json
```json
{
  "username":"admin",
  "password":"1234",
  "region": "us-west-2",
  "manifestFormat": "sofe|importmap",
  "locations": {
    "default": "sofe-manifest.json",
    "prod": "s3://cdn.canopytax.com/sofe-manifest.json",
    "test": "sofe-manifest2.json"
  }
}
```
The `region` is the s3 endpoint region (not needed if not using s3).
